### Project Desciption
Use job sql statement to create more useful sql statement.
### Modify Method
1. Observing the sql statement we have. We can make a simple conclusion:
   1. sql statement are all SELECT statement with 3 parts: SELECT ... AS ...; FROM ... AS ... ; WHERE condition AND ...
   2. all the FROM map has the same form and the same map relation
2. We can random make a sample of all the where conditions. Then we will use the where condtions to generate the FROM part and the SELECT part.
### Difficulties
1. How to correctly divide the where condition is not easy.
2. You should make a simple remove number operation to make the FROM map.
3. Some sql statement will cost too much time.
4. Some sql statement may be syntax error.

## Test
### Problem
How to solve the unlimited time cost when excuting one statement.

### Solution
1. Use the configuration in postgres. Limit the maximum statement time cost. It will automatically throw an timeout error when the excuting one statement with too much time.
2. The configuration is /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf and change the following one:
- statement_timeout = <need>s
3. You must restart you postgresql service or nothing will happen even you have change your configuration. 

### Problem
How to keep the program running when something like an exception occurs?

### Solution
1. You should perdict the problem you may meet. Like the syntax error in the sql statement you create or the too much time cost. When these exception happens, just use the try ... catch ... module to keep the porgram continue to work.
